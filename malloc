how is malloc used?

to allocate a certain amount of memory during the execution of your application. 
 it will request a block of memory from the heap. 
The operating system will reserve a block of memory for your program,
When you are done with the block, you return it to the operating system for recycling by calling the free() function. 
***************
	int *p;
	p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
	free(p);   //frees memory
******************
For example, the following code demonstrates the simplest possible use of the heap:
 This function does three things:
 malloc statement first looks at the amount of memory available on the heap and asks
"Is there enough memory available to allocate a block of memory of the size requested?" 
The amount of memory needed for the block is known from the parameter passed into malloc 
 			-- in this case, sizeof(int) is 4 bytes. 
 If there is not enough memory available, 	
 		it returns the address zero to indicate the error ( NULL ).
  Otherwise
malloc proceeds.
	"allocates" a block from the heap of the size specified. 

The system then places into the pointer variable (p, in this case) the address of the reserved block. 
The allocated block is able to hold a value of the type specified and the pointer points to it.
